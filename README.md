# esx_tax

This resource is an updated version of the original esx_tax by forum user [itsamayo](https://forum.cfx.re/u/itsamayo)(Github [AshKetchumza](https://github.com/AshKetchumza)) for ESX which adds a simple taxing system that taxes players based on bank balance and amount of owned personal vehicles as well as owned properties. Rented properties won't be taxed. Tax goes through the esx_billing system paid to the society account set by the SocietyAccount option in the config.
